## Why and What
MPCC assistant is our website for serving MPCCs, The website tracks the progress of the arriving visitors, where each process takes some time and lots of reminders, our website is designed to automate some of these processes.

____________

```js
if (mpcc.problem) we.solve();
```

## User stories
Our site can track and hunt down your current progress -as an mpcc- and tell you what to do next, simple but not easy.
1. Our user needs to have a database for the arriving mentors -visitors- in order to review and restore their data.
2. The user should also be able to add new mentors or reschedule with exisiting mentors.
3. Each mentor has a progress-tracking page, in order to see completed and remaining tasks, and what to do next.
4. Each step that a mentor goes in has a substep or two, some steps are simply checked or reminded with, some require some more work.
