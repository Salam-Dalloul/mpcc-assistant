    "content": "Hi #mentor_name#, \nWe are really excited that you’ve chosen to come mentor at Gaza Sky Geeks! \nWe would like to start the process of applying for a permit right away. \nThe Israeli Gaza entry permit typically takes 4 weeks to obtain but can take longer. \nPlease send the following ASAP so we can have your permit application ready to submit: \nA color scan (or good picture) of your passport \nNB: all permits are issued based on the passport details you send me, \nso you need to cross using the same passport. \nAny changes to the current passport should be reported to me immediately.​ \nFill out this Google form with all info required (this will take 5 minutes) \nA color headshot photo with white background. \nSince things in Gaza are always subject to change and we cannot guarantee that your permit will be granted. \nWe have almost always been able to secure permits, \nbut it is very common that we don’t find out until days before your trip. \nI will be in contact shortly with detailed information on visiting Gaza, \nsecurity information, mentorship/workshop content. \nI remain available for any questions you may have in the meantime! \nThanks, \nSara",
